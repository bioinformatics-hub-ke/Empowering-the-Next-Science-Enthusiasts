## Empowering the Next Science Enthusiasts
### Bioinformatics and Open Science University Outreach Events  

In 2021, the outreach program of the Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya initiative [BHKi](https://bhki.org/) was launched with the aim of increasing awareness and understanding of the concepts of open science and bioinformatics among undergraduate and graduate students in Kenyan universities who are pursuing degrees in the life science fields. The goal is to encourage the adoption of open science practices in their research. The program was motivated by the knowledge gap that exists regarding bioinformatics and open science among undergraduate students. The program includes professional lectures on bioinformatics and open science, breakout sessions with Bioinformatics Master's and PhD students who share their study experiences, as well as networking sessions where students can engage with each other over refreshments.

BHKi has effectively executed outreach programs in three universities: Technical University of Kenya (TUK), Mount Kenya University (MKU), and Chuka University. The purpose of these programs aligns with BHKi's primary objective, which is to bridge the knowledge gap between early-career researchers and bioinformatics experts.

Our plan is to organize three additional outreach programs in 2023, which will take place between May and December at the University of Nairobi, Moi University, and Maseno University. Our target audience will be students studying life sciences, with a particular focus on those enrolled in biochemistry, biotechnology, general biology, medical laboratory technology, and computer science.

Here is the proposed program of the event: 

| **Talk** | **Objective** | 
|:---------------------------------- |:------------------------------ | 
| Trends in bioinformatics | General overview of bioinformatics, what is bioinformatics in simplest terms <br/> What fields in bioinformatics <br/> Applications of bioinformatics in life science <br/> Potential opportunities - both part time online jobs and full-time jobs in the region and outside (where to explore) <br/> Areas to be keen when pursuing bioinformatics <br/> A glimpse of data science in genomics<br/> |
| Leveraging Open Science in Bioinformatics  | Introduce open science concept <br/> Open science taxonomy and skills <br/> Application of open science tools in research and bioinformatics <br/> Benefits of practicing open science |
| Networking session | Students will be grouped into small groups led by a member of BHKi. The goal is to motivate students <br/> Open discussion - introduce themselves <br/> Leads share their bioinformatics journey |


The Open Life Science Program  [OLS](https://openlifesci.org/), BHKi, and Dr. Caleb Kibet have provided funding for our previous outreach events, which have enabled us to reach between 150 to 200 students in each university.
